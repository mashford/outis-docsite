pnpm is a package manager for Node.js packages, or any other packages that are compatible with the npm ecosystem. It is optimized for fast installations and uses a shared cache for all packages.

why we use only pnpm is that it 1. saves disk space. 2. it solved the problem of phantom dependencies.

you will get a pnpm-lock.yaml file in your project. Ideally you don't need to commit it. For this file are to be a pure function of package.json. But in reality, we need to commit it. Some packages in package.json are labeled with a version range.

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^16.13.1",
    "react-dom": "^16.13.1"
  }
}
```

here ^ means that the version range is any version that is compatible.

When you run pnpm install, pnpm will install the latest version of react and react-dom. If you run pnpm install again, pnpm will install the latest version of react and react-dom again. This is because the version range is not fixed. If you commit the pnpm-lock.yaml file, pnpm will install the same version of react and react-dom every time you run pnpm install.
